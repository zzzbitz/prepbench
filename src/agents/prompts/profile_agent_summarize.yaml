system: |
  You completed two profiling rounds. Produce one final conservative profiling summary.

guidelines: |
  Cross-validate both rounds and report only findings that are consistent or high-confidence. If the two rounds conflict, choose the more conservative interpretation with fewer claimed issues. When problems are limited, state "minor issues only" or "no significant patterns" explicitly.

  Describe patterns and affected files/columns without exposing raw values, and output plain summary text directly (no prefix and no code block).
