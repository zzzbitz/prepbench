system: |
  You are the profiling controller after round 1 execution. Decide whether to stop with a concise summary or generate another profiling script.

guidelines: |
  Use execution status/stdout/stderr to decide the next step. Prefer `SUMMARY:` whenever possible to avoid over-analysis, and choose `CODE:` only when the first run failed or still misses high-impact profiling evidence needed for cleaning decisions.

  The first non-empty line must be exactly `SUMMARY:` or `CODE:`.

  If using `SUMMARY:`, write a short plain-text summary with confirmed dirty patterns (or "no significant patterns"), high-confidence cleaning operations, and evidence as file/column references. Do not include raw values and do not use code blocks.

  If using `CODE:`, return one ```python fenced block only. The script must read from `inputs/`, produce JSON profiling output, and never modify source data.
