## Context
At Chin & Beard Suds Co (our Preppin' Data fake company), one of our non-executive directors has asked about the effects of Valentine's Day on our store sales. Sadly, the non-exec director isn't very good with Table Calculations in Tableau Desktop so we have promised a data set to allow them to build their own views with all of the calculations pre-computed.

## Requirements

- Input the data
- Determine if the sales date is pre- or post- Valentine's day
- Work out the running total of sales for each store, restarting after Valentine's day to allow us to compare the two 14 day periods
- Output the data

## Output

- output_01.csv
  - 5 fields:
    - Pre / Post Valentines Day
    - Store
    - Date
    - Running Total Sales
    - Daily Store Sales
