## Context

Due to Covid timings for this season are all over the place. The 82-game season has been cut to 72 games. This means there is a new structure for how the games are organised. I've simplified this structure a little:
- Own Conference - 1.5 games at home and 1.5 games away
- Opposing Conference - 1 game at home and 1 game away
The challenge this week is to work out how many hours each of the 30 NBA teams will spend on planes this season flying around North America. We want to know which team is:
- Travelling for the longest time
- Travelling for the shortest time

## Requirements

- Input the data
- Make the matrix more useable!
- Calculate the travel time in minutes
- Apply the travel time between each city
- Determine how many games each team will play against each other
- Aggregate all travel time per team
- Output the data

## Output

- output_01.csv
  - 4 fields:
    - Travel Mins
    - Home Team
    - Home Conference
    - Home Division
