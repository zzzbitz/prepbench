## Context

One of the features that many users have requested is to solve a common challenge in Excel, to copy down data from the cell above if it is currently null.
As a human, we look at this data table and assume that Jenny manages Chelmsford, Ipswich and the Norwich stores of Chin & Beard Suds Co. We assume Tom manages the next four stores. Jonathan manages Northampton and Leicester.
However, many data tools don't make this same assumption and it is difficult to apply this assumption - especially when correct.

## Requirements

- Input the data
- This challenge is about how do you copy down the name of the Store Manager into the null cell below.
- Leave no nulls in the table
- I'm not going to give many clues as I'm looking forward to seeing what you do to resolve this.
- Rules
  - No manual entry of data points though!!
  - We want solutions that would work if this table got bigger and we added another manager for different stores.
  - No use of the Script Step
- Output the data

## Output

- output_01.csv
  - 3 fields:
    - Store Manager
    - Store
    - Sales Target
