## Context

C&B Suds Co is reviewing its soap packaging and delivery process to reduce wasted box space and, primarily, to minimize the number of separate boxes used per order. The company ships orders using a fixed set of box capacities (including 120-, 24-, and 6-soap boxes) and needs two deliverables: (1) an order-level summary of how many boxes of each size are used, and (2) a box-level detail file listing every box shipped for every order.

## Requirements

- Input the data.
- Use the provided list of available box capacities from the box-sizes input. Treat “Order Size” as the total number of soaps that must be packed for that order.
- For each order, determine the required boxes using this deterministic packing logic:
  - Sort available box sizes from largest to smallest.
  - For each box size in that order, allocate as many full boxes of that size as possible (integer division of remaining soaps by the box size), and reduce the remaining soaps accordingly.
  - After processing all sizes, if there is still a positive remainder, add exactly one box of the smallest available size containing that remainder (a partially filled smallest box).
- Arrange the order-level results so there is exactly one row per order with separate fields for the counts of 120-, 24-, and 6-soap boxes.
- Output the above.
- For the box-level detail output, expand each order into one row per physical box shipped:
  - Create one row per full box allocated (with “Soaps in Box” equal to that box’s capacity).
  - If a partially filled smallest box is added, include it as one additional row with “Soaps in Box” equal to the remainder packed into that box.
- Assign each box in each order a unique “Box Number” starting at 1 for each order.
- Set “Box Number” so that numbering is ascending from the box with the most soap to the box with the least soap (i.e., sort boxes within each order by “Soaps in Box” descending before numbering). If multiple boxes have the same “Soaps in Box”, keep their relative order consistent with how boxes were generated by the packing logic.
- For each box row, populate “Last Box Per Box Size” as the total number of boxes of that same “Box Size” used in that order (the same value repeated across all boxes of that size within the order).
- Output the above as well.
- Output the data.
