## Context
Occasionally, candidates may choose to withdraw from the hiring process. The Talent Acquisition team would like to understand where in the hiring process candidates are choosing to drop out.

## Requirements

- Input the data
- Rank the statuses based on the timestamp (ts) field, where the most recent status is 1
- If the most recent status (rank #1) is “Candidate Withdrew”, find the previous status (rank #2)
- Count the number of withdrawals, grouped by the previous status
- Count the total number of candidate/positions that have ever been in each status
- Join the total counts by status to the withdrawals by status
  - Make sure that statuses with no withdrawals are included in the output
- Calculate the % of candidates who withdrew after each status (round to 1 decimal place, e.g. output “2.5” for 2.5%)
- Clean up the columns so four columns remain:
  - status_before_withdrawal
  - total_candidates
  - withdrawals
  - Pct_withdrawn
- Output the data

## Output

- output_01.csv
  - 4 fields:
    - status_before_withdrawal
    - withdrawals
    - total_in_status
    - pct_withdrawn
