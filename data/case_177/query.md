- Input the data
- Create a new field which would break down milliseconds into seconds and minutes
  - e.g. 208,168 turned into minutes would be 3.47min
- Extract the year from the timestamp field
- Rank the artists by total minutes played overall
- For each year, find the ranking of the artists by total minutes played
