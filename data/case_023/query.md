## Context

We need to talk about Dave... he's a good salesman but he's not our analysts' best friend. Dave is "too busy" to consistently enter his data. He likes to sometimes hit CAPS LOCK. Does Dave even know the shift key exists? Our challenge this week is to tidy up the messy data Dave has left behind him by creating a nice data set so we can analyse his sales, favourite customers etc.

## Requirements

- Input the data
- Bring in all tabs of the Excel Sheet
- Create the date of the sale
- Create a column for the scent of the product
- Create a column for the product
- Create a column for the customer name - with the customer's name in Title Case
- Output the data

## Output

- output_01.csv
  - 6 fields:
    - Date
    - Name
    - Value
    - Scent
    - Product
    - Notes
