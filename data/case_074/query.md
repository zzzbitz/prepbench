## Context
This week's challenge comes from our fellow Tableau Challenge Sports Viz Sunday. The data set in question has sadly gotten a little messed and manipulated from the lovely Summer Olympics data set they had produced. There is one Excel file for the task this week with two separate tabs:
1. Host Cities of Summer Olympics - this is your main data set this week
2. Scaffold - this will help with one part of the task

## Requirements

- Input the data
- Convert the Roman numerals to numerical values
- Determine the Year of the Olympics
  - Each Roman numeral is four years apart even if the games wasn't held
- Create a Start Date for the Games (in DD/MM/YYYY format)
- Create an End Date for the Games (in DD/MM/YYYY format)
- Remove unnecessary fields
- Remove the null dates
- Output the data

## Output

- output_01.csv
  - 7 fields:
    - Start Date
    - End Date
    - Games
    - Host
    - Nations
    - Sports
    - Events
