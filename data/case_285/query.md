## Context

- Create a field for the Decade the competition took place in
- Filter the data to 1950s onwards
- Create a Match ID field so every row in the data has a unique identifier
- Calculate the number of matches in each Decade, in each Competition
- Filter out the nulls from the Goal Scorers table and join to the dataset
- Join on the Segment table based on what segment of time the goal was scored in (e.g., 25 minutes → 15-30 segment)
- Count how many goals were scored in each Segment, for each Competition and Decade
- Calculate the Expected number of Goals for each Segment, Competition and Decade
- Output the data
