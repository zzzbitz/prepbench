## Context

Analysing messages from the Data School What's App group. Don't worry we are not sharing any insights in to what the Data Schoolers think of their coaches (phew!) as they have replaced their actual messages with The Bards of Wales by Janos Arany, translated by Neville Masterman. The real data is who sent the message and when plus an additional data source that let's you know whether the day was a weekday / weekend day or public holiday (what us Brits call a Bank Holiday). Kamilla and Bona want the following questions answered:
- Who sent the most messages overall?
- Who sent the highest percentage of messages whilst at work?
  - Working hours are9a to5pm with a lunch break12-1
