## Context
Chin & Beard Suds Co has some stock level challenges... basically our inventory is down to nothing as our customers are just loving our products. We need to restock our stores but firstly, we have to deal with our Suppliers. Sadly, our suppliers can only guarantee delivery based on a day of the week and a certain week within the month. This week's challenge is to merge together these two datasets to allow us to do analysis in future weeks. We need to understand how much stock will be available when each month until the end of the year.

## Requirements

- Input the data
- Delivery Schedule
- Date Scaffold
