## Requirements

- Input the data
- Determine how many students are in each year for each subject
- Work out how many hours of teaching is required for the students based on the age of the students
- Work out the room capacity for each subject
- By assessing the number of days someone works, how many hours of teaching are potentially available within a week:
  - Each day has 6 hours of potential teaching 9-12 and 1-4
  - Each teacher can only teach certain subjects and certain ages
  - Teachers who cover multiple subjects should have an even allocation of their time between those subjects.
- Using that data set calculate:
  - Potential Teachers Hours
  - Total Teaching Hours Needed
  - Classes Required
  - % Utilised (Total Teaching Hours Need / Potential Teachers Hours)
- Output the data
