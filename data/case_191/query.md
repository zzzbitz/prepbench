## Context
I loved multiplication tests as a child... yes, I know that's a little weird but for anyone who knows me they might just be nodding right now. This week's challenge is to replicate a 9x9 multiplication grid (or times table as I called them as a child). Sounds easy, right? The input file is just the number 1 and 9 this week. Also I'm not going to offer instructions as to what you need to do as I'm intrigued to see what you all come up with.

## Requirements

- Input the data
- Create a 9x9 multiplication table
- Output the data

## Output

- output_01.csv
  - 10 fields:
    - Number
    - 1
    - 2
    - 3
    - 4
    - 5
    - 6
    - 7
