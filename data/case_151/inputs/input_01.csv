Name,Complaint
Carl,The state of the toilets were not suitable for a field let alone first class
Carl,Call that food? The bread was so stale. I thought weapons weren't allowed onboard? I should have been able to bring more onboard in my luggage but the price was too high. 
Anya,"Urgh, the food. They run out of tomato juice in the first five minutes of the flight. How can you be on a plane without tomato juice!?"
Ian,I'm really disappointed the pilot didn't fly past my house
Sophie,I have seen tins of sardines with more leg room than I had. Not worth it for the price I paid.
Carl,"I am only 5' 3"" and I still didn't have leg room in economy. I'm just thankful I do yoga!"
Sophie,While I love children as much as the next person. I didn't appreciate being sat next to what appeared to be the entire Kings College Choir's under 1 year olds
Anya,"The lugguage compartment door wasn't working, and I got hit by my own bag 3 (!!!) times during an hour flight :("
Oscar,The baby changing facilities were not suitable for my high standards
Toni,The free socks in the flight accessories were not as soft as advertised
Toni,The USB socket had broken in my seat. How am I supposed to entertain my baby for all of that time?
