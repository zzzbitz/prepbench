## Context
This week will focus on your user choosing the output they need. For this challenge, our sales team in each of our store's need to be able to download the top 10 liquid products, size and scent combinations. To save yourself time and effort, try to do this with one flow and use a parameter that your user can select their own store.

## Requirements

- Input the data
- Split the Product Name field into Product Type and Size
- Only keep the Liquid products
- Total up the sales for each Product Size and Scent for each Store
- Rank each of the Product Size and Scent combinations for each Store
- Only leave the top 10 based on total sales value calculated above
- Round the Sales Values to the nearest 10 value (ie 1913 becomes 1910)
- Create a parameter to select the store
- Ensure the output only contains the chosen store
- Output the data
