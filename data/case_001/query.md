## Context

Welcome to your first Preppin' Data challenge. This week, Jonathan and I would like you to look at taking a simple Excel file on Car Sales and complete the following requirements:

## Requirements

- Input the data
- Make a date that will work in Tableau Desktop (from When Sold Year and When Sold Month)
- Work out the total car sales per month / per car dealership
- Retain the car sales per colour columns
- Output the data

## Output

  - 7 fields:
    - Total Cars Sold
    - Date
    - Dealership
    - Red Cars
    - Silver Cars
    - Black Cars
    - Blue Cars
