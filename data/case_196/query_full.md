## Context
The input file is a wide-format table where months run across the columns, and for each month there are two measures: Sales and Profit. The goal is to reshape this into a tidy, long-format dataset with one row per store per month and a constructed date.

## Requirements
- Input the data from `input_01.csv`.
- Split off (extract) the Year from the first row of the file by locating the 4-digit year value in that first line. Use this extracted year for all output rows.
- Identify the Month headers from the dedicated month row near the top of the file (the row that lists month abbreviations across the columns). Treat the first column as the Store label column and collect the non-empty month labels from the remaining columns.
- Read the main data table so that each subsequent row represents a Store and the remaining columns contain repeated Sales/Profit pairs for each month in order.
- Pivot/reshape the data from wide to long at the following grain:
  - One output row per **Store × Month**.
  - For each month, map the paired columns to:
    - `Sales` = the first column in the pair for that month
    - `Profit` = the second column in the pair for that month
- If the intermediate column names are autogenerated (e.g., `F1`, `F2`, etc.), remove the leading `F` so the remaining suffix can be treated as a simple column index when organizing the pairs.
- Create a `Date` field from the extracted Year and the Month, formatted as a string in `DD/MM/YYYY` with day fixed to `01` and month converted using:
  - `Jan`→`01`, `Feb`→`02`, `Mar`→`03`, `Apr`→`04`, `May`→`05`, `Jun`→`06`, `Jul`→`07`, `Aug`→`08`, `Sep`→`09`, `Oct`→`10`, `Nov`→`11`, `Dec`→`12`.
- Ensure `Sales` and `Profit` are numeric and output them as integers.
- Output the data.

## Output

- output_01.csv
  - 4 fields:
    - Store
    - Date
    - Sales
    - Profit
