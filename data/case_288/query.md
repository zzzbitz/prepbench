## Requirements

- Input the data
- Determine each student's birthday for this school year
  - The school year starts on 1st September and ends on 31st August the following year
- Create a Cake Day field that shows when the school needs to buy each student a cake to celebrate their birthday. The Cake Day rules are:
  - If your birthday falls on a school day, you will receive cake on that day
  - If your birthday falls on a Saturday or Sunday, you will receive a cake on the Friday before that weekend
  - You might notice the 1st Sept is a weekend day so those kids will have received their birthday cake in the previous school year.
  - If your birthday falls on a day during a holiday, you will receive your cake on the last Friday in the previous school term
- Count how many cakes are needed for each school day and what day of the week that day is.
- Output the data
