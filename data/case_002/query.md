## Context

So what’s the data? We need you decide where you are going to in the UK; London or Edinburgh, purely based on the weather (every Brit’s favourite subject). edit - you need to update to at least version 2019.1 or there are some serious work-arounds to be done!

## Requirements

- Input the data
- Get rid of those nicely formatted titles - no-one is viewing this in Excel!
- Make sure you get all the data in the Excel sheet loaded in to Prep
- Clean up the City names to create two cities in one column (London and Edinburgh)
- Pivot the data to give a measure per column for the four metrics in the data set
- Output the data

## Output

- output_01.csv
  - 6 fields:
    - City
    - Date
    - Wind Speed - mph
    - Max Temperature - Celsius
    - Min Temperature - Celsius
    - Precipitation - mm
