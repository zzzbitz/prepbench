- Assign Secret Santas to Secret Santees that follow them in the alphabet
  - i.e. Ellie should be the Secret Santa for Emma

- Some of the email addresses contain typos. Clean them up
- To make life easier, we're planning on automating sending the emails. Create a field for the Email Subject and a field for the Email Body
