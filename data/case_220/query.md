## Context
After just 1 day with Tableau Prep, Data School Cohort number 39 were tasked with creating some training content on the following steps:
* Input
* Clean
* Pivot
* Aggregate
* Output
They went above and beyond to create a challenge for Preppin' Data that used each of these steps! What's more, they even created their own company: The Nut House! Let's tidy up the data so we can see the Total Revenue for each Location.

## Requirements

- Input the data
- Clean up the location names
- Reshape so that we have a field for each measure
- Calculate the Revenue
  - Price * Quantity
- Aggregate the data so we can perform our analysis at the Location level. We want to see the:
  - Total Revenue
  - Avg. Price per pack
- Output the data

## Output

- output_01.csv
  - 3 fields:
    - Location
    - Revenue
    - Avg. Price (£) per pack
