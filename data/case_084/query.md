## Context
This week we are going to have a bit of fun and taken inspiration from one of the Alteryx Weekly Challenges. For this week's challenge we want to build a workflow that will allow us to identify whether two words are anagrams of each other. We have selected some words that are related to Tableau Prep & Preppin Data, so can you tell if they are anagrams or not?

## Requirements

- Input the data
- Determine whether the words are Anagrams. There are the following rules:
  - Anagrams are formed by re-arranging of another word (on the same row)
  - All anagrams are one word only
  - No letter can be used more than once
  - All letters must be used
- Output the data

## Output

- output_01.csv
  - 3 fields:
    - Word 1
    - Word 2
    - Anagram?
