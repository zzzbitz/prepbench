## Context

This week's challenge involves helping Chin & Beard Suds Co. go global. We are looking to expand our stores' footprint overseas and therefore need to look at potential costs and returns from those potential sites. An agency has done lots of the work for us but they aren't the best at data entry. They've sent a messy file that they haven't had time to clean up so any inaccurate data should be removed.

## Requirements

- Input the data
- DO NOT USE ANY TYPED CALCULATIONS
  - Calculations created by Tableau from other features selected is fine
  - You are allowed to change data field names
- Add Currency conversion rates (don't change everything to USD)
- Remove the rows of any inaccurate City / Country names
- We only want the store per zip code that could the most sales
- Remove any instances where the Store Cost is higher than Potential Store Sales
- Output the data

## Output

- output_01.csv
  - 7 fields:
    - City
    - Country
    - Zip Code
    - Store Cost
    - Store Potential Sales
    - Currency
    - Value in USD
