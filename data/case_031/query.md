## Context
Chin & Beard Suds Co has a problem in the North of England. A number of customers are not following the normal buying behaviour. We would normally expect a customer to:
1. Place an Order
2. Have the Order sent to them
3. Review the products online
But this hasn't been happening. We have convinced our sales team to send us their first 10 days sales of 2019 to help us spot the trend. We need you and your data preparation skills to help us understand why. Jonathan and I would like to understand:
1. Average Time for a customer to have their order sent after placing their order
2. Average Time for a customer to review their products after we sent their order (for those that have reviewed)
3. In how many cities have customers not had their order sent after placing an order
4. For orders sent, which % of each cities orders have not been sent out within 3 days or less
