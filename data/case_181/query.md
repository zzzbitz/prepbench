## Context

Chin & Beard Suds Co (C&BSCo) have been recording the percentage contribution of the top 3 sales people in each of their stores. They want to know how much value this actually equates to. This week's challenge will let you experience one final technique we haven't used this month yet, Unions.

## Requirements

- Input the data
- Combine these files
  - Bonus challenge for experienced Preppers - take the Region Name from the File Name. For newer Preppers, use the Region name field from the Week 27 Input later in the challenge
- Input the 'Store Lookup' file to provide the name of the Stores instead of the ID number
- Remove any duplicate fields you have in the data set so far
- Input the Week 27 Input file
- Use Week 27 Input file to create Sales Values for each Store
- Combine this data with the rest of the prepared data
- Use the data set you have created to determine the actual sales value (rather than percentage) for each sales person
  - Multiply the Sales Person percentage contribution against their Store's total sales for the year
- Output the data

## Output

- output_01.csv
  - 6 fields:
    - Sales per Person
    - Region
    - Store Name
    - Sales Person
    - Percent of Store Sales
    - Sale Value
