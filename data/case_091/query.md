## Context

For those who have taken part in the Preppin' Data for a while you know we love Chin & Beard Suds Co to provide some 'fun' data challenges. Well we are excited to announce the take-off of our new business: Prep Air is our airline that will fly between some of the World's major data hubs as well as when the Dr Preppers basically want to take a well earned holiday. We saw an opportunity to enter the market whilst air travel struggles but we believe our airline that is based on great data-driven insights is a fantastic way to go. This Week's challenge Clearly this hasn't been the best year to start an airline. Our Chief Financial Officer (Jenny) likes to remind me of that everyday but we've started now so this week's challenge will help me persuade her that there is a future for our fledgling airline. I want to take the first 3 months of revenue and show how the rest of the year's revenue would have likely amassed if the world hadn't stopped. When flying all over the world, the different seasons affect demand to fly to certain locations so this needs to be factored into the revenue projections. Projections have been given for each country as the destination of the flight affects the amount of sales value that can be gained.

## Requirements

- Input the data
- Determine Quarterly Sales Value, Target and Variance of Sales to Target for each Route
- Make the Quarterly Projections for Destinations data set usable
- Apply the projections to the Q1 Sales Value
- Total Yearly Sales, Target and Variance to Target for each route factoring in the projections.
