## Context
At Chin & Beard Suds Co, we have come across another data challenge where customers who buy multiple products have their products held in a slightly complex way. Each product is listed in it's own column so two products sold leads to two separate product columns. You challenge is a fundamental one this week, to create a more logical way to hold this data.
We've thrown in an address clean up challenge for you too just to spice things up a little! US Zipcodes are a lot easier to understand than UK Postal Codes so enjoy the oddity if you are not used to them!

## Requirements
- Input the data
- Provide the address columns specified in the output
- Put all the products in one column, same for sales
- Clean the product names to remove punctuation
- Output the data

## Output

- output_01.csv

    - Property Number
    - Town
