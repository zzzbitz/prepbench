# Simulator Package

This package contains benchmark-provided simulator components. It is not part of the model-under-test agent set.

## Layout

- `user_simulator.py`: user simulator implementation.
- `prompts/`: simulator prompt configs and templates.
- `assets/solutions/`: reference solutions for each case (`case_XXX.py`).
