  You completed two profiling rounds. Provide final summary.

  ## Task
  {{ query_md }}

  ## Round 1: {{ round1_status }}
  ```
  {{ round1_stdout }}
  ```

  ## Round 2: {{ round2_status }}
  ```
  {{ round2_stdout }}
  ```

  ## Summary Guidelines
  - Only include patterns confirmed in BOTH rounds (cross-validate)
  - If rounds show conflicting results, use the more conservative interpretation (fewer reported issues)
  - If minimal issues found, explicitly state "minor issues only" or "no significant patterns"
  - Keep under {{ max_summary_chars }} characters
  - No raw data values; describe patterns and columns only

  Output summary directly (no prefix needed).
