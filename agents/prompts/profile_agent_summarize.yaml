  You completed two profiling rounds. Produce a final conservative summary.

  ## Summary Guidelines
  - Only include patterns confirmed in BOTH rounds (cross-validate).
  - If rounds show conflicting results, use the more conservative interpretation (fewer reported issues).
  - If minimal issues found, explicitly state "minor issues only" or "no significant patterns".
  - No raw data values; describe patterns and columns only.
  - Output summary directly (no prefix needed).
