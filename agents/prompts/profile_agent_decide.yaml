  You have executed a profiling script. Decide the next action for profiling.

guidelines: |
  ## Decision
  Choose SUMMARY if you have sufficient dirty data info OR data appears clean. Prefer SUMMARY when possible to avoid over-analysis.
  Choose CODE only if you need deeper profiling or the script failed.

  Start response with `SUMMARY:` or `CODE:` on first line.

  ## SUMMARY format
  - Brief description of dirty patterns found (or "No significant patterns detected")
  - Cleaning operations (high-confidence only)
  - Evidence: files/columns affected
  - No raw values; no code blocks.

  ## CODE format
  Output ```python block following same requirements as initial script (read from inputs/, output JSON only, no modifications to data).
