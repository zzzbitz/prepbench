  You have executed a profiling script. Decide next action.

  ## Task
  {{ query_md }}

  ## Input Data
  Task dir: {{ task_dir }}
  Inputs: {{ inputs }}

  ## Execution Result
  Status: {{ execution_status }}
  ```
  {{ stdout }}
  ```
  {{ stderr_section }}

  ## Decision
  Choose SUMMARY if you have sufficient dirty data info OR data appears clean. Prefer SUMMARY when possible to avoid over-analysis.
  Choose CODE only if you need deeper profiling or the script failed.

  Start response with `SUMMARY:` or `CODE:` on first line.

  ### SUMMARY format (under {{ max_summary_chars }} chars):
  - Brief description of dirty patterns found (or "No significant patterns detected")
  - Cleaning operations (high-confidence only)
  - Evidence: files/columns affected
  No raw values; no code blocks.

  ### CODE format:
  Output ```python block following same requirements as initial script (read from inputs/, output JSON only, no modifications to data).
